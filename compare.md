The **ggml-model-q4_k.gguf** and **ggml-model-q8_0.gguf** models differ primarily in their quantization levels, which impact memory usage, inference speed, and output quality.

- **ggml-model-q4_k.gguf**: This model uses **Q4_K quantization**, meaning it applies **4-bit quantization** with optimizations for balancing memory efficiency and performance. It is designed to reduce memory footprint while maintaining reasonable accuracy, making it a good choice for resource-constrained environments.
- **ggml-model-q8_0.gguf**: This model uses **Q8_0 quantization**, which applies **8-bit quantization**. It offers **higher precision**, meaning it retains more of the original modelâ€™s accuracy but at the cost of increased memory usage and slower inference speed.

### Key Differences:
| Feature            | ggml-model-q4_k.gguf | ggml-model-q8_0.gguf |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Quantization**   | 4-bit (Q4_K)        | 8-bit (Q8_0)       |
| **Memory Usage**   | Lower               | Higher             |
| **Inference Speed**| Faster              | Slower             |
| **Output Quality** | Moderate            | Higher             |

If you need **efficient memory usage and faster inference**, Q4_K is preferable. If **higher accuracy** is more important and you can afford the extra memory cost, Q8_0 is the better choice.
