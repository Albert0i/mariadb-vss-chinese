**BM25 keyword expansion** is a technique used to improve **search recall** by expanding a user's query with **related terms, synonyms, or variations**. This helps retrieve more relevant documents, especially when the original query is too narrow.

### 🔹 **How BM25 Keyword Expansion Works**
1. **Synonym Expansion** – Adds synonyms or related words to the query (e.g., `"global warming"` → `"climate change"`).
2. **Stemming & Lemmatization** – Expands words to their root forms (e.g., `"running"` → `"run"`).
3. **Conceptual Expansion** – Includes broader or related concepts (e.g., `"AI"` → `"machine learning"`).
4. **Entity Expansion** – Adds variations of named entities (e.g., `"New York"` → `"NYC"`).
5. **Contextual Expansion** – Uses **word embeddings** or **semantic similarity** to find related terms.

### 🔍 **Why Use BM25 Keyword Expansion?**
- **Improves recall** by retrieving more relevant documents.
- **Enhances search accuracy** when queries are vague.
- **Works well with hybrid search** (BM25 + vector embeddings).
